# ride
an experiment to port some of the corange engine to rust in order to learn rust programming language

any parts not implemented yet are commented out, there are many. This was just enough to get the teapot demo working
satisfactorily

should work on windows, linux, mac osx, with latest rust stable 1.43 or newer, probably some earlier versions as well.

again, the coin demo is not implemented, but the teapot demo is

so from the base directory:
# \> to build
cargo build

# \> to run the teapot demo
cargo run

Thanks!
